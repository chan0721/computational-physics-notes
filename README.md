# computational-physics-notes
This is my private notes taken in Computational Physics B class in Fudan University in 25 winter semester.  
This course is given by Prof. Suoqing Ji and Prof. Dingyu Shao, which contains two different fields in physics, astrophysics and particle physics.  
My notes are mainly from courses of Prof. Ji, covering some important physical concepts and computational methods in astrophysics, especially in turbulence.    
If you find some errors in my notes, please contact me with yang_c23@fudan.edu.cn, I will appreciate for that.
